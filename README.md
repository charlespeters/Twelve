## Really Simple SASS Mixins to Create a Grid Layout

Declare

```
@include container($container);
```

and you can pass it a `max-width` of whatever you'd like.

and for the columns of your grid

```
@include col ($span, $context);
```

`$span` is a number of columns across and '$context' is total columns in your grid.
